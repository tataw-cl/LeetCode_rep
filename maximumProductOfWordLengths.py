# Given a string array words, return the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
# Output: 16
# Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
# Example 2:

# Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
# Example 3:

# Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: No such pair of words.
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= words.length <= 1000
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
# words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.


# My Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def maxProduct(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        bitmask = [0] * len(words)
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            for char in word:
                bitmask[i] |= 1 << (ord(char) - ord('a'))
        max_product = 0
        for i in range(len(words)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
                if bitmask[i] & bitmask[j] == 0:
                    max_product = max(max_product, len(words[i]) * len(words[j]))
        return max_product
    

# Time complexity: O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words.
# Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of words.
