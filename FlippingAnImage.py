# 832. Flipping an Image
# Solved

# Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

# To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

# For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].
# To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.

# For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].
 

# Example 1:

# Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
# Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
# Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
# Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
# Example 2:

# Input: image = [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
# Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
# Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
# Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
 

# Constraints:

# n == image.length
# n == image[i].length
# 1 <= n <= 20
# images[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

                    row[i] = 1
                else:

        return image
        

            
#Time Complexity: O(n^2)
#Space Complexity: O(1) because we are using the same array image to store the result
