# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

# A leaf is a node with no children.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: true
# Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
# Output: false
# Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
# (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
# (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
# There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
# Output: false
# Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000


#My Solution:
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def hasPathSum(self, root, targetSum):

        :type targetSum: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        if not root:
            return False

        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return targetSum==root.val

        remainder=targetSum-root.val

        return(self.hasPathSum(root.left, remainder) or self.hasPathSum(root.right, remainder))
        

        #Time Complexity: O(n)
        #Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.


# Other Solution:
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

        if not root:
            return False

        stack = [(root, targetSum - root.val)]

        while stack:
            node, current_sum = stack.pop()

            if not node.left and not node.right and current_sum == 0:
                return True

            if node.left:

        #Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
        #Space Complexity: O(n), for the stack used in DFS.
