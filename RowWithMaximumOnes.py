# 2643. Row With Maximum Ones

# Hint
# Given a m x n binary matrix mat, find the 0-indexed position of the row that contains the maximum count of ones, and the number of ones in that row.

# In case there are multiple rows that have the maximum count of ones, the row with the smallest row number should be selected.

# Return an array containing the index of the row, and the number of ones in it.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]]
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Both rows have the same number of 1's. So we return the index of the smaller row, 0, and the maximum count of ones (1). So, the answer is [0,1]. 
# Example 2:

# Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1]]
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The row indexed 1 has the maximum count of ones (2). So we return its index, 1, and the count. So, the answer is [1,2].
# Example 3:

# Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,0]]
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The row indexed 1 has the maximum count of ones (2). So the answer is [1,2].
 

# Constraints:

# m == mat.length 
# n == mat[i].length 
# 1 <= m, n <= 100 
# mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

# My Solution:

    def rowAndMaximumOnes(self, mat):

        :type mat: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]

        if not mat:
            return [-1,0]
        n=len(mat)
        maxRow=[0,0]
        for i in range(n):
            count=0
            count=sum(mat[i])
            if count>maxRow[1]:
                maxRow[0]=i
                maxRow[1]=count
