# 162. Find Peak Element

# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
# nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.


#My Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l,r=0,len(nums)-1
        while l<=r:
            mid=l+((r-l)//2)
            #Condition to search on left side
            if (mid<len(nums)-1) and nums[mid]<nums[mid+1] :
                l=mid+1

            #Condition to search the right side of list
            elif (mid>0) and nums[mid]<nums[mid-1]:
                r=mid-1
            else:
                return mid
            

#Time Complexity: O(log n)
#Space Complexity: O(1)



#Other Solution:
# This solution is more optimized than the above one.
