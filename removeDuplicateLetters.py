# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters
# Solved
# Medium
# Topics
# Companies
# Hint
# Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "bcabc"
# Output: "abc"
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
# Output: "acdb"
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of lowercase English letters.

#My Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        stack = []
        seen = set()
        last_occurrence = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in seen:
                while stack and c < stack[-1] and i < last_occurrence[stack[-1]]:
                    seen.remove(stack.pop())
                stack.append(c)
                seen.add(c)

        return ''.join(stack)
