# Hint
# Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 2
# Output: [0,1,1]
# Explanation:
# 0 --> 0
# 1 --> 1
# 2 --> 10
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 5
# Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
# Explanation:
# 0 --> 0
# 1 --> 1
# 2 --> 10
# 3 --> 11
# 4 --> 100
# 5 --> 101
 

# Constraints:

# 0 <= n <= 105
 

# Follow up:

# It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
# Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?

#My Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def countBits(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ans = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
        
        return ans
    
#Time complexity: O(n), where n is the input number.
#Space complexity: O(n) for the output list.
