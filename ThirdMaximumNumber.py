# 414. Third Maximum Number

# Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,2,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# The first distinct maximum is 3.
# The second distinct maximum is 2.
# The third distinct maximum is 1.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The first distinct maximum is 2.
# The second distinct maximum is 1.
# The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# The first distinct maximum is 3.
# The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
# The third distinct maximum is 1.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 

# Follow up: Can you find an O(n) solution?

# My Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def thirdMax(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        uniqueNums=set(nums)
        sortedList=sorted(uniqueNums, reverse=True)
        if len(sortedList) <3:
            return sortedList[0]
        else:
            return sortedList[2]
        
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(n)


# Other Solutions:
class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return max(nums)
        nums.remove(max(nums))
        nums.remove(max(nums))
        return max(nums)
